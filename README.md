# Sorting-visualizer
## Description
The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive desktop application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to input a custom array and visualize various sorting algorithms in action. This project is educational and helps users understand how different sorting techniques work step-by-step through graphical animations.

### Key Features:
- **User Input for Array**: Users can enter their own array of numbers to sort.
- **Visualization of Sorting Algorithms**: Animations display how each algorithm processes the array.
- **Sorting Algorithms Supported**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Customizable Speed**: Users can control the speed of the animations (in milliseconds).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive graphical interface for better user experience.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
